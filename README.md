# Delegates

An example of the use of Delegates! This has been been superseeded by the built in Action and Func types in C# 3.0.

The Action and Func loose a little bit in readability, as in they do not have customised names. They are used by defining an Action of Func followed by the generic type as in <int, int, int>, the last one in the case of Func being the output type (Action returns void therefore is not specified).
